vimconfig
=========

This is my personal vimrc I use to ensure all of my systems are in sync with the same plugins, mappings, etc. For whatever reason you want to use this config, you must download and install Vundle which can be found here http://github.com/gmarik/vundle. Then install the plugins by doing:

Launch vim and run **:PluginInstall**

or

To install from command line: **vim +PluginInstall +qall**
